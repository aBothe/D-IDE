

When resolving a type, what is needed to do this?

Go from the most inner scope level to the outmost level.

class A
{
}

void main()
{
	if()
	{
		A ma=new A();
	}
}

1) The identifier(-list) of the wanted type




Commenting:

/** Comment A*/
int a; /**
	even more stuff
*/

/// Comment B
int b;
